# edcert-revokeserver
A TCP based server, which can be used to verify that a certain certificate has not been revoked.

__THIS SERVER HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED__

Since this server can't use SSL, we decided to use a php script.
This can be found [here](https://github.com/zombiemuffin/edcert/blob/master/revoke-server/api.php).
